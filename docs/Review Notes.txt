 Your experiments are just a list of questions. 
 - We expect details on how you will answer these questions? 
 - Which data sets? 
 - What metrics? 
 - What will you do with the data? 
 - How will they determine success or impact your direction?

What would enable real-time fraud detection and how is it different than applications used every day by financial institutions? 
 Overall, there are a lot of claims being made without detail to back them up.; Be clear on innovations and specifics on evaluations
